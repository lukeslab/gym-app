exercise history table with user id's as refrence??

{
    user: ObjectId(user),
    exercise: ObjectId(exercise),
    exercise-set-history: {
        0: {
            setNumber: 1,
            target: {
                reps: 10,
                sets: 3,
                weight: 20
            },
            actual: 10,
            isComplete: true
        }
    }
}


Sessions would keep track of sessions to see past ones maybe and also the one that is currently open.

{
    user: ObjectId(user),
    workout: ObjectId(workout),
    status: in progress || complete,
    setCardsData: []
}
